# graphql api auth template

this is a graphql api authentication template so i don't have to start from scratch everytime

### usage

if you want to use this template,

-   clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/samarthkulshrestha/graphql_api_auth_template.git
```

    npm install
    ```

    -   either with npm

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    -   or with yarn

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

-   you will see a bunch of output, that is the logging, and the url will be output in the end.
